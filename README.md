# Private Repository for ML Instruction

### DS/DA/MLE Interview Cheatsheet

#### CORE Technical Knowledge: (Know them cold, A.K.A, whiteboard them from scratch; no other way around)
1. Probability: Distributions, Brainteaser Problems, Bayesian/Conditional Probability, Maximum Likelihood
2. Basic Statistics: CLT, Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Moments (Mean, Median, Mode, Quantiles, Variance, Covariance, Correlation, Skewness)
3. Advanced Statistics: Ordered Statistics, Sampling Methods, Importance Sampling, MCMC, Bayesian Statistics, Nonparametric Testing, PSM
4. Regression: OLS, logit, GLS, WLS, Possion regression, ordered regression; interpretation of coefficients 
5. ML Supervised: KNN, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree and CART, DNN, CNN, RNN, SVM
6. ML Unsupervised: Kmeans, Gaussian Mixture, PCA

7. Numerical methods: GD, SGD, Batch GD, dropout, Batch normalization, under-sampling, over-sampling
8. ML key concepts: Loss function, Backprop, Bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting/underfitting, hyperparameters and tuning, cross-validation, classification (precision, recall, f1, accuracy, class weight, ROC/AUC)
9. A/B Testing: A/A Testing, bias and variance, variance reduction, Doubly Robust Estimator, Double ML + Heterogeneous Treatment Effect

#### CORE Coding Skills: (Know them cold, A.K.A, efficient syntax + bug free; no other way around)
1. SQL/Spark-SQL: join, group by, window functions, self-join, date functions
2. Pandas: basic <-> advanced data manipulation (anything written in SQL, rewrite them in Pandas)
3. Optional for DA; Required for some DS and all MLEs, Leetcode (BFS, DFS, Sort, DC, DP; Data Structures; Complexity Analysis)

#### CORE Analytical Skills
