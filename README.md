2. Basic Statistics: CLT, Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Moments (Mean, Median, Mode, Quantiles, Variance, Covariance, Correlation, Skewness)
3. Advanced Statistics: Ordered Statistics, Sampling Methods, Importance Sampling, MCMC, Bayesian Statistics, Nonparametric Testing
4. Regression: OLS, logit, GLS, WLS, Possion regression, ordered regression; interpretation of coefficients 
5. ML Supervised: KNN, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree and CART, DNN, CNN, RNN, SVM
6. ML Unsupervised: Kmeans, Gaussian Mixture, PCA

#### CORE Coding Skills: (Know them cold, A.K.A, efficient syntax + bug free; no other way around)
1. SQL/Spark-SQL: join, group by, window functions, self-join, date functions
2. Pandas: basic <-> advanced data manipulation (anything written in SQL, rewrite them in Pandas)
